# ShortBoi

## Information
ShortBoi is a URL shortener tool. The app takes any URL and generates a unique (and much shorter) redirecting URL for you to use! The app also generates unique QR codes tor easier link sharing! Are you wondering if you have to register? No chance your URLs are associated to your IP address and only you can manage them, while everyone can access them! 

*Create your first link!*

### For local use:
#### Installation:
- Clone this repository locally and `cd` into the folder
- Run `pipenv shell && pipenv install && pipenv run dev`
- The app will start on port 5000
- N.B. If you want to interact with your local DB you will need to change all the strings with the shortboi URL with localhost:5000, sorry :(
    + These strings are only present in app.py and results.html
